# Snow*, a powerless programming language, certainly not meant to be learnt by you if you don't feel brave enough.

What is Snow* ?<br>
Snow* is:
  - a language born in hell of assembly languages.
  - itself a reason why you shouldn't learn it.
  - not finished yet. It has to be rewritten because of the source code loss.
