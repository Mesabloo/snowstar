## :grey_question: What is Snow* ?

[![license](https://img.shields.io/cran/l/devtools.svg)](./LICENSE)

Snow* is a programming language which knew several generations:

* The first one called [RainDrop](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#raindrop) was an Object-Oriented programming language.<br>
It really never took off in the first place, being always a theoritical project more than anything else.

* The second one was called [#*](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#sharpstar) (SharpStar)<br>
It was an ASM-like language with some inconsistences (registers holding only up to one value).<br>
It was the real first programming language made here from nothing. The VM was slow, the compiler inefficient.

* The third generation was the first called [Snow*](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#snowstar1).<br>
It was still an ASM-like, but more developped than the previous one. It contained more instructions, the VM was faster, the compiler more efficient.

* The fourth generation, [Snow*](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#snowstar2), a procedural programming language.<br>
This generation is built with ANTLR and LLVM to offer power and native compilation.

* The fifth generation, [Snow*](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#snowstar3), a pseudo-functional programming language.<br>
This generation is also built with ANTLR and LLVM to offer some more power as well as native compilation.

## :desktop_computer: Behind Snow*, a developer, Mesabloo.

I've been working on Snow* from the second generation until now since the beginning of June 2018. I wanted to create my own programming language since the beginning of October/November of 2017. ([RainDrop](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#raindrop) came to life around this time) Because I never really understood how they work, and because I wanted to compile RainDrop into ASM (the Assembly Language), it didn't go far enough to actually be considered a good "experience" (just a basic Lexer + a simple compiling process until the AST generation, where I got stuck).<br>
After this, I switched from Java to C++ and completely changed the syntax of the language, creating my first "ASM-like" language.<br>
And now, I changed it again, and I'm ready to go for it.

## :page_facing_up: What about a free sample ?

Samples can be found [here](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#sample-snowstar3) but I will post here a simple `Hello, World!` program made in Snow*:

```fs
(*
 *  Declaration of the main method. The parameter of it is unrequired, you may write it without.
 *
 *  @param `args` is of type Array<String> ;
 *  @return I32
 *)

// So that we can use `println`.
obtain stdout

main: (_: String[]) -> I32 =
    ("Hello, World") |> stdout@println
    0

(*
    This sample is not yet compilable.
    Don't try to compile it, you'll get many errors.
*)
```
