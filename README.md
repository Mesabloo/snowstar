# Snow*, 4th generation

## What is Snow* ?

Snow* is a programming language which knew several generations:

- The first one called [RainDrop](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#raindrop) was an Object-Oriented programming language.<br>
It really never took off in the first place, being always a theoritical project more than anything else.

- The second one was called [#*](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#sharpstar) (SharpStar)<br>
It was an ASM-like language with some inconsistences (registers holding only up to one value).<br>
It was the real first programming language made here from nothing. The VM was slow, the compiler inefficient.

- The third generation was the first called [Snow*](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#snowstar1).<br>
It was still an ASM-like, but more developped than the previous one. It contained more instructions, the VM was faster, the compiler more efficient.

- The fourth generation, [Snow*](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#snowstar2), an Object-Oriented programming language.<br>
This generation is built with ANTLR and LLVM (later) to offer power and native compilation.

## Behind Snow*, a developer, Mesabloo.

I've been working on Snow* from the second generation until now since the beginning of June 2018. I wanted to create my own programming language since the beginning of October/November of 2017. ([RainDrop](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#raindrop) came to life around this time) Because I never really understood how they work, and because I wanted to compile RainDrop into ASM (the Assembly Language), it didn't go far enough to actually be considered a good "experience" (just a basic Lexer + a simple compiling process until the AST generation, where I got stuck).<br>
After this, I switched from Java to C++ and completely changed the syntax of the language, creating my first "ASM-like" language.<br>
And now, I changed it again, and I'm ready to go for it.

## What about a free sample ?

Samples can be found [here](https://mesabloo.github.io/snowstar-lang/about.html#sample-snowstar2) but I will post here a simple `Hello, World!` program made in Snow* 4th gen:
```
#**
    Declaration of the main method. The parameters of it are unrequired, you may write it without.

    @param `argc` is of type integer8 ;
    @param `argv` is of type list<string> ;
    @return integer32
*#

decl main : function<integer32>(decl argc : integer8, argv : list<string>) = {
    print("Hello, World!")
    % We print "Hello, World!" in the console.
    return 0
    % We return from the function, with an integer32 value.
}

#*
    This sample is not yet compilable.
    Don't try to compile it, you'll get many errors.

```
